# First sprint plan

## Day 1
**Learn about deep learning and using Caffe with available models**

* [A Deep Learning Tutorial: from Perceptrons to Deep Networks](http://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks)
* [DIY Deep Learning with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gc2fcdcce7_216_101) tutorial with the hands-on notebooks, try until and inclusive the Classification example.
*  Read persons age/gender classification paper/download models and data (if not done)

## Day 2
**Processing pipeline**
* Run pre-trained network on example test images
* Make caffe work with cars model from notebook
* Make nice Python script (test, docopts etc)
* Create docker image that does car classification non-interactively
* Repeat for age/gender classification

## Day 3
**Produce integration code and lessons learnt page**
* Finish up pipeline
* Prepare Lessons learned page
