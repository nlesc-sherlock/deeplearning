# First sprint plan

## Day 1
**Learn about deep learning and using Caffe with available models**

* [A Deep Learning Tutorial: from Perceptrons to Deep Networks](http://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks)
* [DIY Deep Learning with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gc2fcdcce7_216_101) tutorial with the hands-on notebooks, try until and inclusive the Classification example.
*  Read persons age/gender classification paper/download models and data (if not done)
*  Run pre-trained network on example test images

## Day 2
**Processing pipeline**
 * Design and implement simple processing pipeline- from image to classification (persons use case).
 * Test pipleine
 * Read car model classification paper/download models and data (if not done)
 * Test pipeline for the car classification use case

## Day 3
**Produce integration code and lessons learnt page**
* Finish up pipeline
* Prepare Lessons learned page
