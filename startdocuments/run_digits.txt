Running DIGITS
==============

Setup server - interactive
------------

- Start up on a node with GPU (load modules there) and start the DIGITS server:

srun --ntasks=1 --time=00:15:00 --gres=gpu:1 -C TitanX --pty bash -i

module load cuda70/toolkit
module load cuda70/blas
module load hdf5_18/1.8.12
module load openblas

# see caffe_install.txt for stuff you need to put in your .bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile

module load protobuf

# set $GITBASE correctly, e.g. export GITBASE=$HOME/git
cd $GITBASE/digits
./digits-devserver

- See also https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildDigits.md

- Get the IP address of the node that the server is running on. E.g. for
  node001, do ping node001 from the head node and note down the IP address
  (10.141.0.1 in this case).


Setup server - non-interactive (can logout)
------------

First start a screen on the head node. In the screen, start a dummy job to
reserve a GPU node (adjust sleep time to match job time):

srun --ntasks=1 --time=3-11:00:00 --gres=gpu:1 -C TitanX /bin/sleep 298800

Open a new screen tab (`CTRL-a c`) and login to the node you got assigned to
(find out which with squeue), e.g. for node001:

ssh node001

There, set up a screen as well, just to be sure (it's probably not really
necessary). In the screen, start the server, just as in the interactive way:

module load cuda70/toolkit
module load cuda70/blas
module load hdf5_18/1.8.12
module load openblas
. ~/.bash_profile
module load protobuf
cd $GITBASE/digits
./digits-devserver

Now, you can detach from the screen with `CTRL-a d`.


Setup proxy to server
---------------------

- Set up an SSH proxy on your local machine to the DAS headnode:

ssh -TnN -D 8080 ${USER}@fs0.das5.cs.vu.nl

- To use the proxy from Firefox, go to Preferences, Advanced, Network, press
  "Settings...", select Manual proxy configuration and fill in the SOCKS Host
  as "localhost" and the port as 8080 (select Socks v5 below that).
  To use the proxy from Chrome, start up a new session with command:

chromium-browser --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost"

- Alternatively, use a plugin to automatically manage proxies, like FoxyProxy
  (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/).


- If you happen to be on a location where you can't access DAS (they only
  allow IPs on the whitelist), you could set up the proxy on a location that
  does have access and make an SSH tunnel to there on your local machine with:

ssh location_with_access -L 8080:localhost:8080 -N


Connect to server through proxy
-------------------------------

- Finally, from your browser that is connected to the proxy, browse to your
  DIGITS server at 10.141.0.1:5000.
