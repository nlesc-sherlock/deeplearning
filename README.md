Deep learning topic in Sherlock 

*Note:* This repo doesn't contain the usecases datasets. They are stored at an external drive and while testing they could be copied to local Datasets directory with usecases AdienceFaces and CompCars.

The goal for the final part of the project is to create the workflow below. Components that are done are ticked. Definition of done here is that there is a working version of this component available that is ready to be plugged into the CWL workflow. Components that are done can still have some work-items/issues/tasks for improvements.

The input of the workflow is an image, and the output of the workflow is a json document describing the content of the image.
