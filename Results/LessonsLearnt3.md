## Lessons learnt from Sprint 3: 16-18 Feb 2016

- updated the new 2 team members of what we have done on the first 2 sprints.

We have learnt 
- How to install DIGITS on each person's account
- How to import predefined network:

  - If the network originates from a standart network like GoogLeNet, use the Custom Network train_val file of the standart network. 
    The train_val shared in Caffe Zoo are not always accepted by DIGITS
    
  - Put your pretrained model in a reachable folder, i.e./var/scratch rather than in your homedirectory
