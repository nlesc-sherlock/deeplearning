# Lessons learnt

## Day 1

We have learnt about neural networks and deep learning basics from 
[A Deep Learning Tutorial: from Perceptrons to Deep Networks]
(http://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks). 
Types of network elements: Perceptron, Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzman Machines (RMB) and how to train them.
We have learnt about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and how they are used for image classification. 
We have looked at the MNIST hand written digit recognition example from
http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html.

We have started the Caffe hands-on tutorial
[DIY Deep Learning with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit?pli=1#slide=id.gc2fcdcce7_216_101) 
When at the classification IPython notebook example we ran into the problem of how to run such a notebook from 
within the docker container with Caffe. 
We have figured it out as described in our 
[startup guide](https://github.com/nlesc-sherlock/Sherlock/blob/master/topics/deeplearning/startupguide.md).
