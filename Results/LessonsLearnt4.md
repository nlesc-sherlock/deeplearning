#Lessons learnt from Sprint 4: 10 - 12 May 2016

* Fine tuning of a CNN in DIGITS doesn't work smoothly, instead we train it directly in Caffe. For more info see the IPython notebook:....
* Collecting images of cars (~700 models, 70 000 images) via Bing from Internet. The dataset is quite noisy.
* Visualizing a netwrok using VisDeep toolbox....
* Docker is very useful for **deployment**, not for containerizing every random piece of software. Don't use it by default, use it mainly for server-like-thingies.
